## [1.1.2] - 2025-07-19

### Fixed

### Improved
- **Agent Instruction Clarity**: Eliminated confusion about when to run the command generation script
  - Removed premature script execution instructions from requirements phase

- **Timing Clarity**: Made it crystal clear that scripts run ONLY after tasks approval
- **Anti-Editing Warnings**: Added explicit instructions not to modify the generation script

### Technical Details
- Updated `src/commands.ts` with corrected workflow sequence for both `/spec-create` and `/spec-tasks`
- Enhanced `src/claude-md.ts` with prominent workflow sequence and script usage rules
- Removed confusing early script execution instructions from requirements phase
- Added multiple reinforcement points about proper script timing and usage

## [1.1.1] - 2025-07-19

### Fixed
- **Command Generation Instructions**: Made script execution mandatory and explicit in workflow commands
  - Updated `/spec-create` command with prominent "MUST EXECUTE" instructions for script execution
  - Updated `/spec-tasks` command with explicit "ACTION REQUIRED" language for script execution
  - Added clear warnings at the top of command instructions about script execution requirement
  - Enhanced CLAUDE.md documentation with explicit timing for when to run the script

### Improved
- **Agent Compliance**: Agents now receive clear, mandatory instructions to execute the command generation script
  - Changed passive language ("Run the script") to active mandatory language ("MUST EXECUTE")
  - Added prominent placement of script execution instructions at the top of commands
  - Specified exact timing: "immediately after requirements approval" and "immediately after tasks approval"
  - Multiple reinforcement points ensure agents understand the requirement

### Technical Details
- Updated `src/commands.ts` with explicit script execution instructions in `/spec-create` and `/spec-tasks`
- Enhanced `src/claude-md.ts` with clear workflow steps including mandatory script execution
- Added "REQUIRED after approval" sections with action-oriented language
- Maintained backward compatibility while improving agent instruction clarity

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-19

### Added
- **Auto-Generated Task Commands**: Individual commands are now automatically created for each task in a spec
  - Commands like `/user-auth-task-1`, `/user-auth-task-2.1` are generated automatically
  - Each command calls `/spec-execute {task-id} {spec-name}` with proper parameters
  - Commands are organized in spec-specific folders: `.claude/commands/{spec-name}/`
- **Command Generation Script**: New script at `.claude/scripts/generate-commands.js`
  - Parses `tasks.md` files and creates individual task commands
  - Supports hierarchical task numbering (1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.)
  - Called automatically during `/spec-create` and `/spec-tasks` workflows
- **Enhanced Directory Structure**: Added `.claude/scripts/` directory for automation scripts
- **Improved Workflow Commands**: Updated `/spec-create` and `/spec-tasks` to generate task commands

### Changed
- **Command Organization**: Commands are now organized with main workflow commands at root level and spec-specific commands in subfolders
- **CLI Output**: Added mention of auto-generated task commands in setup success message
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md, CLAUDE.md, and CLI help to explain new command structure
- **Directory Structure**: Extended setup to create `.claude/scripts/` directory

### Enhanced
- **User Experience**: Easier task execution with shorter, more intuitive command names
- **Auto-Completion**: Claude Code can now suggest spec-specific commands
- **Organization**: Better command organization with clear separation between main workflow and task-specific commands
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing commands continue to work unchanged

### Technical Details
- Added `src/scripts.ts` with command generation functionality
- Updated `src/setup.ts` to create scripts directory and files
- Enhanced `src/commands.ts` with instructions for command generation
- Updated `src/claude-md.ts` with new command documentation
- Added comprehensive tests for new functionality
- All 18 tests pass including new script creation tests

## [1.0.4] - 2025-07-19

### Changed
- Removed all "Kiro" references from codebase and replaced with "spec-driven" terminology
- Updated package description to use "spec-driven workflow" instead of "Kiro-style"
- Removed "kiro" keyword from package.json keywords array
- Updated source code comments and documentation to use consistent "spec-driven" language

### Technical Details
